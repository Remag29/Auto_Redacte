# Auto_Redacte

---

## Description

Little extension to auto fill classic words on the web game Redactle.  
The purpose of this extension __is not to do the redactle for you !__  
Simply to automate the entry of your favourite input word list.
  
## Load the extention

For now the extension is not packaged. You have to go through chrome developer mode :

- Go to the Extention section
- Switch to developeur mode
- Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and select the folder containing the source files
- _Et voilà_ !

## Warning
**This is probably the most trash project you've ever seen !**  
More seriously, this project exists primarily because I wanted to play with js, html, css or chrome extention, and practice on it. So a lot of _rookie mistakes_ are gonna get in my code.  
Try my best. Have fun ❤️
